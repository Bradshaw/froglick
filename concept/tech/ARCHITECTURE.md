Client/Server architecture
==========================

We will use a REST model.
The server hosts campaigns as folders with XML files. Clients can request status and the server responds with a view of the game from the player characters's point of view.
Clients can also submit a turn, and when all player characters have a submitted turn, the server simulates the turn and saves the changes in the XML.

What is important is that the game is run on the server and that it is sent to the client in a formalised XML structure. This will make writing clients easy as poop, and keeps everything (kind of) tidy.
