Client/Server architecture
==========================


Representational State Transfer
-------------------------------

We will use a Representational State Transfer (REST) model.

The server hosts campaigns as folders with XML files. Clients can request status 
and the server responds with a view of the game from the player characters's 
point of view.
Clients can also submit a turn, and when all player characters have a submitted 
turn, the server simulates the turn and saves the changes in the XML.
In other words the server must do the following:

+ Buffer character turn choices, which are sequences of actions.
+ Generates a new XML representing the state of the game world, based on 
character actions.
+ The XML file is stored on the file-system (node.js) or in the client local
storage (HTML 5).
+ Send to each client information on the part of the world that their character 
can see.

What is important is that the game is run on the server and that it is sent to 
the client in a formalised XML structure. This will make writing clients easy 
as poop, and keeps everything (kind of) tidy.


Example communcication
----------------------
This is an example of a first-time player's interactions with the server:

+ Client: GET *index*
+ Server: send *login* page
+ Client: GET *create account* page
+ Server: send *create account* page
+ Client: POST user name, password, email
+ Server: send session cookie, *character creation* page
+ Client: POST character
+ Server: send *campaign* page
+ Client: GET *shop*
+ Server: send *shop* page
+ Client: GET *silenced pistol* 
+ Server: send *silenced pistol* page
+ Client: POST buy silenced pistol
+ Server: send *shop* page
+ ...
+ Client: GET *loadout*
+ Server: send *loadout* page
+ Client: POST equip silenced pistol, equip stealth suit
+ Server: send *loadout* page
+ Client: GET *missions*
+ Server: send *missions* page
+ Client: GET *mission 1*
+ Server: send *lobby* page
+ Client: POST invite my friend John
+ Server: send *lobby* page
+ Client: AJAX refresh
+ ...
+ Client: POST start mission
+ Server: send *mission* page
+ ...
+ Client: get *debriefing*
+ Server: send *debriefing* page
+ Client: get *campaign*
+ Server: send *campaign* page
+ ...


HTML5 Web Storage?
------------------
Using the HTML 5 *localStorage* object we can store this XML data client-side:
no need to run a server of any kind. This is not to be confused with the 
*sessionStorage*, which is deleted when the browser is closed.
