Example campaign
----------------------


Kevin creates a character called Dufus. Dufus is initialised as a neuro-oriented 
character, with high SKILLZ but low GUNZ. Kevin uses Dufus' currency to purchase 
a light armor, a few neuro attack and a small gun.

### Mission 1 ###
#### Game ####
Kevin doesn't have any friends online, so he attempts an easy mission for a 
local businessman at Black Hat industries against the Deep Stone corporation.
Two objectives:

+ Objective 1: Hack into Deep Stone mainframe and retrieve design documents.
+ Objective 2: Kill George Tillman, Deep Stone engineer

Dufus enters the building, when he meets George:
George: *"No! Please don't shoot me!"*
Dufus: *"Get out of here and stay out of my way! I don't kill if I don't have 
to!"*

Dufus then hacks the computer and retrieves the documents.

#### Meta-game ####

Awarded credits: 

+ objective 1: 500/500
+ objective 2: 0/500
+ total: 500

Awarded qualities:

+ Contact: Black Hat I
  + gives access to "Milliwave scanner" neuro module in the store.
+ Contact: Deep Stone I
+ Reputation: Clemency I

"Black Hat I" combined with "Clemency I" gives access to a Level 2 mission 
of type "Rescue our scientists".

Kevin spends 200 credits on repairing the armor, then accepts mission 
"Rescue our scientists"

### Mission 2 ###
#### Game ####
This mission is more difficult, so Kevin invites William and Hannes.
William's character, Rufus, is a soldier. Hannes' character, Lupus, has 
good detection capabilities.

During the mission, Rufus manages to extract the scientists, Lupus finds 
secret documents and Dufus dies under fire.

#### Meta-game ####
Rufus gains reputation and contacts, Lupus also gains reputation and 
unlocks a story arc with his documents, and since Dufus died, Kevin now 
has to create a new character.

All is not lost though, having unlocked the Milliwave scanner module, Kevin 
now has this option permanently, and decides to create a new character with 
this module.
