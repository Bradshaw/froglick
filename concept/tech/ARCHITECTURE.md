Client/Server architecture
==========================

We will use a REST model.
The server hosts campaigns as folders with XML files. Clients can request status and the server responds with a view of the game from the player characters's point of view.
Clients can also submit a turn, and when all player characters have a submitted turn, the server simulates the turn and saves the changes in the XML.
