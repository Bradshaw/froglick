Example campaign
----------------

Kevin creates a character called Dufus. Dufus is initialised as a neuro-oriented character, with high SKILLZ but low GUNZ. Kevin uses Dufus' currency to purchase a light armor, a few neuro attack and a small gun.

Kevin doesn't have any friends online, so he attempts an easy mission for a local businessman at Black Hat industries against the Deep Stone corporation.
Two objectives:
Objective 1: Hack into Deep Stone mainframe and retrieve design documents.
Objective 2: Kill George Tillman, Deep Stone engineer

Dufus enters the building, when he meets George:
George: "No! Please don't shoot me!"
Dufus: "Get out of here and stay out of my way! I don't kill if I don't have to!"

Dufus then hacks the computer and retrieves the documents.

End of mission.

Awarded credits: 500 (contract was for 1000 but only one objective complete)
Awarded qualities:
	Contact: Black Hat I
	Contact: Deep Stone I
	Reputation: Clemency I

"Deep Stone I" give access to "Milliwave scanner" neuro module in the store.

"Black Hat I" combined with "Clemency I" gives access to mission: "Level 2: Rescue our scientists"

Kevin spends 200 credits on repairing the armor, then accepts mission "Rescue our scientists"

This mission is more difficult, so Kevin invites William and Hannes.
William's character, Rufus, is a soldier. Hannes' character, Lupus, has good detection capabilities.

During the mission, Rufus manages to extract the scientists, Lupus finds secret documents and Rufus dies under fire.

Rufus gains reputation and contacts, Lupus also gains reputation and unlocks a story arc with his documents, and since Rufus died, Kevin now has to create a new character.

All is not lost though, having unlocked the Milliwave scanner module, Kevin now has this option permenantly, and decides to create a new character with this module.
