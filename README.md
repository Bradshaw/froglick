Hannes, William and Kevin's epic Froglick game!
===============================================

Hannes, William and Kevin are awesome game makers in Montpellier France,

Design
======


+ Concept
  =======
	+ This game will be a rogue-like game with action-platformer elements.
	+ The character is a space explorer stranded on a planet, infected by a mysterious fungi
	+ He has to heal himself by using an antidote fungi that grows in the environment
	+ As he presses on in the depths of the planet, he encounters the local fauna, also infected
	+ If he survives long enough, perhaps he will glipse the dark secrets that this planet holds

+ Basic Gameplay
  ==============
	+ Your character is infected, go too long without healing yourself, and you may perish
	+ Orange fungi grows in the caves, maybe they can heal you
	+ There are other fungi, perhaps they have interesting effects
	+ Your gun seems receptive to the strange crystals, use them to modify your combat abilities
	+ Don't get too close to the strange monsters, you're good at range, but they have a nasty bite


+ Game design
  ===========
	+ I will detail this in another segment...
